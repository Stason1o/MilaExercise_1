COLLECTIONS: TASK 1

1.	Create class Worker with following fields: firstName, lastName, age, readyForTrip and a collection of countries where he can go. 
2.	Create class that will contain data structure for storing hire date and worker. Initialize this data structure with minimum 20 values. Add the same worker several times with different hire dates. Sort by date.
3.	Write a method workersReadyForTrip(LocalDateTime startDate, LocalDateTime endDate) that will pick up those workers who are able to go to business trips and were hired in the range of time [LocalDateTime startDate - LocalDateTime endDate]. Make sure that there are no duplicates in this list.
4.	Write a method that will check if worker can visit exact country.
5.	Write a method that will make unmodifiable collection, that will store country name and the collection of workers that are going to visit it. Sort it by name of country desc.
6.	Make as many methods as possible private.
7.	Try to call from main as few methods as possible. I expect you to call from main method Nr 5 and print it results. 

COLLECTIONS: TASK 2
1.	Simple LRU cache. You have to create your own data structure for this. Choose cleverly interface or class from which it inherits. 
2.	This cache should save only 50 most active users. In main I would like to see the evidence that it works. 
3.	Thatâ€™s it. Have fun and pleeeeease be concise. :)
